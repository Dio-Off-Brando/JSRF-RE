## Directories


#### Cache
I don't know yet


#### Disp
I would say maps and sprites for graffitis

#### Ending
Ending Dialogue, since we can see it was planned for 5 languages

#### Enemy
Enemy models and effects

#### Event
There are 2 directories inside, one called Event and the other called TextEvent. Probably for animations

#### Font
2 fonts in .bin

#### Garage
Unknown

#### Mark
3 directories (DEFAULT, PRESS, TEX), and xbx files, maybe libraries.
the TEX folder is full of "Targa image data - RGBA 128 x 128 x 32 - 8-bit alpha", i would say sprites but for what?
PRESS is filled with files named JSRF_TEXT_*.dat, so i asssume theyre textures.
the DEFAULT folder contains 25 files, each named GRF_*__*.*P


#### Misc
contains Misc.bin and Misc.dat

#### Mission
has about 630 files, each named mssn*.dat. I would assume theyre missions but their headers contains strange data. like mssn3334.dat is a dos executable...? etc

#### People
contains People01.dat and People01.bin, which is a boot sector?

#### Player
contains files named with character names, so I think there are models for those characters
